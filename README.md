# MY-PYTHON-ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-GAME
This is the repository i created for the second udacity python tutorial project.

It contains one file called **_rps.py_**. Inside the file are the python lines of codes that made the game playable as directed by the udacity intro to programming course team .

Anyone interested can use it as a guide to implement his or her own **rock paper scissors** game.

**THANK YOU**
